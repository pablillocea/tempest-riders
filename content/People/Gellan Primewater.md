![[gellan.jpg]] 
Gellan is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town.

Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He appears to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind other council members.
## Events
- **Session 04.** He was seen by both Bram and Chuck during [[Maximus Magnanimus| Maximus]]' speech outside the Council Hall.
- **Session 05.** The party successfully stole a shard of an enchanted piece of glass he won at an auction.
- **Session 06.** He sent out people lead by a mysterious [[Old Man]] to retrieve what was rightfully his from the hands of the party. After a nasty confrontation, the group succeeded and stole the glass back.
