Baila is a middle-aged halfling woman currently staying at the [[Buff Fey]] (inn & tavern). She's an outspoken fan of [[Maximus Magnanimus|Maximus Magnanimus the Magnificent]] and tries to attend all his public appearances. She's knitted a hooded cape emulating Maximus' helmet.
## Events
- She was seen at the [[Buff Fey]] on a heated debate with [[Brolin]], who had the audacity to refer to [[Maximus Magnanimus]] as "Max".
- She later sat with the party and [[Manistrad Copperlocks]], whom she seem to know from beforehand.
- She was spotted by Bram and Chuck during [[Maximus Magnanimus|Maximus]]' speech on the front row, completely focused on the podium.
