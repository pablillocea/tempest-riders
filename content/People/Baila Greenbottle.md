![[baila.png]]

Baila is a middle-aged halfling currently staying at the [[Buff Fey]] (inn & tavern). She's an outspoken fan of [[Maximus Magnanimus]] and tries to attend all his public appearances. She's knitted a hooded cape emulating Maximus' helmet.
## Events
- She was seen on a heated debate with [[Brolin]], who had the audacity to refer to [[Maximus Magnanimus]] as "Max".
- She later sat with the party and [[Manistrad Copperlocks]], whom she seem to know from beforehand.
- She was spotted by Bran and Chuck during Maximus' speech on the front row, completely focused on the podium.
