## Description
Once upon a time, eight centuries ago, a group of enlightened individuals known as the Seabound Sages came together with a shared mission. Having witnessed the catastrophic power of a magical amulet that provoked the oceanic deity CaiCai into unleashing a universal flood, they resolved to ensure that such calamity would never befall the world again. They retrieved the amulet from the greedy king who had misused it, pacifying CaiCai with a promise of its destruction. Yet, foreseeing a potential future need for the amulet's power, they chose to hide it instead.

To ensure the amulet's safety, the Sages devised an intricate system of safeguards. They crafted the astrolabe, a celestial navigation tool that would reveal the amulet's location when unlocked. To prevent misuse, they created a unique cypher and inscribed it on the astrolabe, understandable only to those who knew the key. Furthermore, they produced five rings, one for each Sage, that functioned as keys to unlock the astrolabe.

Their pact of secrecy and safety led the Sages to blend in with the world, hiding their true identities to keep the amulet and astrolabe safe. They committed to a rotating system, with the astrolabe being passed from one Sage to another annually during the summer solstice at a seemingly inconspicuous lighthouse that served as their sacred temple.

However, as the centuries passed, the system began to falter. Some Sages died unexpectedly without transferring their knowledge or rings, others lost their rings, and their true significance became obscured in the mists of time. The breaking point arrived when one Sage, fearing exposure, decided to hide the astrolabe and broke the rotation. Tragically, he met an untimely death, taking the astrolabe's location to the grave.

In present times, the Sages are thought to be extinct, their story a faded legend. Yet, some of their descendants unknowingly carry a magical genetic marker linking them to their ancient lineage. Some even possess the Sage rings, unaware of their true purpose. The recent rediscovery of the astrolabe by the Azure Alliance has rekindled the old tale, setting the stage for a new chapter in the saga of the Seabound Sages.
