# The Crimson Kingdom
![[crimson-kingdom.png]]
The Crimson Kingdom is a notorious and powerful pirate organisation that operates throughout the seas, with its dominion over numerous island hideouts and a fleet of feared pirate ships. They are ruthless, cunning, and display an insatiable hunger for wealth, power, and prestige. Its members are a motley crew of outcasts, exiles, and thrill-seekers who have pledged their loyalty to the charismatic and enigmatic Crimson King, [[Erebos|Erebos]]. Their flag, bearing the emblem of a crimson crown, strikes terror in the hearts of sailors and coastal towns, for it represents the onslaught of ruthless piracy and unbridled chaos.
