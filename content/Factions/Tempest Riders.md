The Tempest Riders are a lively, freedom-loving group of pirates known for their fierce independence and renowned navigation skills. This colourful crew hails from different parts of the world, each bringing a unique set of abilities and experiences that contributes to their success on the high seas. Unlike other pirates, the Tempest Riders abide by a strict code of honour, refusing to harm innocents and always sharing the spoils equally among the crew. They are driven by their thirst for adventure, the promise of treasure, and the boundless freedom that the sea offers.
