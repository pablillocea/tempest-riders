The Azurian Alliance is a formal coalition of naval powers that represent different nations across the world. Formed in the face of growing pirate threats, the Alliance is a testament to the cooperative spirit—at least on paper—of its member nations, aimed at maintaining peace and stability on the high seas.

Fleet Admiral [[Lirien Ravenrest|Lirien Ravenrest]], a noble elf from Ulek, is the current leader of the Alliance. She is revered for her wisdom, foresight, and tactical prowess. She is aided by Vice-Admirals from each member nation, including Vice-Admiral [[Darius Ironhand|Darius Ironhand]], a ruthless and ambitious man from Keoland.

Headquartered in the grand fortress Tidegate, the Azure Alliance is a symbol of strength and unity. Its fleets patrol major trade routes and guard critical sea lanes to deter pirates and protect the innocent. With its highly trained personnel and state-of-the-art warships, the Alliance is a formidable force on the open waters.

Though primarily focused on combating piracy, the Azure Alliance is also invested in other maritime concerns, such as the preservation of marine life, advancement of naval technology, and promotion of maritime trade. It actively supports research and exploration expeditions, and is committed to understanding and preserving the mysteries of the sea.

The Alliance's power and influence, however, has also attracted controversy. Critics claim that it is a tool of major naval powers to exert control over smaller nations and manipulate maritime affairs to their advantage. Some also argue that it oversteps its mandate, meddling in internal affairs under the guise of maintaining peace and security.

### The Anchors
The Alliance's special task force, called the "Anchors", are an elite group of naval officers known for their unmatched maritime combat skills and expertise in special missions. The Anchors are appointed by the Fleet Admiral and are under her direct command, with each member nation having a representative.
