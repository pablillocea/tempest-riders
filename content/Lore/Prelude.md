## Context
In this age of piracy, the coastal realms of Faerûn are a collection of powerful city-states, each governed by influential noble or merchant families. These city-states, though divergent in their interests and aspirations, have united to form a single, formidable Navy in response to the ever-growing threat of piracy, known as the [[Azurian Alliance]].

The governance of each city-state is overseen by a council, composed of representatives from the ruling family, merchant guilds, and prominent organisations. These councils are responsible for making decisions that affect their city-states, such as levying taxes, establishing trade agreements, and maintaining relations with the other city-states. In addition, each council appoints one high-ranking officer to represent their city-state in the Navy's leadership.

The Navy itself operates under a rotating command, with the highest-ranking officer from each city-state taking turns in the position of Fleet Admiral. This system of governance is designed to ensure that no single city-state holds too much power over the Navy and that the interests of all city-states are equally represented.

Currently, the Navy is led by the stern and respected Admiral [[Lirien Valanthir]]. Under her command, the Navy has focused on maintaining order and upholding the law in their ongoing battle against piracy. However, there are other, more ruthless Vice-Admirals, who might have their own ideas about how best to eliminate the pirate threat—ideas that may lead to some controversial decisions and precarious alliances.

Despite the united front presented by the Navy, tensions and conflicts run deep within the city-states, fuelled by significant social and economic inequality. The opulent lifestyles of the ruling families and merchant guilds stand in stark contrast to the hardships faced by the lower classes. Corruption is rampant, and the city-states' leaders often exploit their power for personal gain.

Against this backdrop of inequality and injustice, the [[Tempest Riders]], as Robin Hood-like figures, are becoming some sort of folk heroes to the common people, who view them as a symbol of resistance against the oppressive ruling class. Lead by Captain [[Gale Whiskerwind]], they only steal from the wealthy and the Navy, sparing small merchants, fisherman, and civilians, and later spending their loot lavishly at the poorest of towns.
## Prior Events
The story begins with the four of you laying on a beach. Face Down. Unconscious. And to understand how this happened, we must go back a month in time to the Tempest Riders' last successful raid on the Navy.

Under the cover of darkness, you managed to steal valuable loot from a Navy ship, all while keeping your identities concealed. You managed to steal jewels, coins… But among everything that you stole, one object stood out. It was an ancient-looking astrolabe covered with cryptic characters that none of you could identify as belonging to any known language. The astrolabe was stuck, it was impossible to calibrate, and on its back, it had a small slot closely resembling one of your captain's rings.

Upon inspecting the astrolabe herself, the captain's curiosity turned to worry. As she twisted her ring on the slot, the object came loose, and her concern now changed into fear. She smashed it on the ground, but the astrolabe reconstructed itself. She tried a few more unsuccessful approaches until the crew intervened to calm her down.

Once she had collected herself, she gathered the whole crew and shared how she received the ring from her grandmother, who would sing a haunting [[Lullaby|lullaby]] that she could now barely recall.

She wasn’t sure what to make of it. The information you all had was too little and the risk too high. So the crew agreed to investigate—and definitely keep the object safe from the clutches of the Navy.

With the cryptic characters, the song, and the ring as clues, you scoured black markets, taverns, and sought out fortunetellers in search of any information. As tensions mounted among the crew, the lizardfolk [[Iago]] mocked the captain's superstitious reaction and insisted in harnessing the ancient power—if it existed—for the crew. When Iago's demands were met with refusal, he incited a mutiny. However, no one supported him, and [[Gale Whiskerwind]] quickly reestablished order. Shortly after, Iago disappeared from the ship, and everyone assumed he had abandoned the Tempest Riders.

When you next set foot on land, you found both good and bad news. The good news was an old sailor's revelation of tombstone in Saltmarsh bearing an engraving similar to that of the ring. The bad news involved the Crimson Kingdom, a notorious slaver pirate crew led by [[Erebos]], the Crimson King, who were offering a substantial bounty for any information on the astrolabe.

With two potential enemies after you, you set sail toward Saltmarsh, only to be ambushed by the Crimson Kingdom and a treacherous Iago, who had sold the information after learning of the bounty.

Captain Gale, anticipating such a situation, had a contingency plan. Most of the crew would create a diversion, while a smaller group would protect the astrolabe and escape. They would then regroup at the island's ruins within a week.

As the four of you fled with the object, a fierce battle commenced. Your fellow crew members bravely bought you time to escape, but a sudden storm swallowed your small boat. This storm was both a blessing and a curse, concealing your escape but also relentlessly battering your vessel.

The storm ultimately capsized your boat, and you washed ashore on this unfamiliar beach, bruised and battered, the fate of the astrolabe now resting in your hands.
