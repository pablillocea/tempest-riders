Hush, my child, the waves do sing, 
Of gods and kings, a tale they bring 
With mystic guide, a starlit key, 
Guard us from the vengeful sea

In darkened hour, our world's demise, 
Unleashed by greed, the skies now cry
The heaven's gift, a flood set free, 
Guard us from the vengeful sea

Hidden well, a treasure's sign, 
Seeking answers, stars align 
So sleep, my child, in dreams reside, 
Draw wisdom from this tale, confide
