So far the party has encountered two rings featuring two intertwined snakes.
## First Ring
The first ring came from Captain [[Gale Whiskerwind|Gale]]. She got it from her grandmother and always wore it without giving it much thought. Until the [[Tempest Riders]] stole the ancient [[Astrolabe]] and discovered the slot in the back.
## Second Ring
The second ring was dropped in the skeleton room at the [[Haunted House]]. It looks identical to the first ring. In his diary, [[Eadric Hohenheim]], the deceased alchemist who once owned the mansion, linked the ring to an ancient order known as the [[Seabound Sages]].
