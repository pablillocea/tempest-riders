## Inscriptions
### Outer Rim Inscription
_“By starlight’s gleam and planet’s beam, seek ye the path through the unseen seam.”_ This riddle-like phrase would guide the players to use the astrolabe under the night sky, aligning its components with celestial bodies to reveal the location of the ancient temple.

### Inner Disc Inscription
It contains the constellation names and the celestial coordinates in the form of degrees and minutes (akin to longitude and latitude). This would be essentially the star map leading to the portal’s location. Names could be ancient and cryptic versions of the five Seabound Sages, e.g.:
- Sea-Serpent’s Fang (coordinates)
- Kraken’s Grasp (coordinates)
- Merfolk’s Gaze (coordinates)
- Triton’s Echo (coordinates)
- Leviathan’s Crown (coordinates)

### Backside Inscription
"Listen, traveler, to our tale, 
Of ancient sages, and seas that wail. 
Guided by stars, under night's veil, 
Safe from the ocean's raging gale.

Greed once stirred a mournful cry, 
Tears from the sky, we thought we'd die. 
The Eye of Tidalis, our salvation nigh, 
Kept us from the sea rising high.

"Within the cosmos, secrets bide, 
Seek wisdom where the stars collide. 
Trust this tale, in stars we find, 
The silent echoes of our kind."

### Astral Disc Inscription:
This becomes visible only in the Astral Sea. It has the astral coordinates (in a similar format to the celestial coordinates) for the pocket dimension housing the Tear of Tidalis. Names here could correspond to the Astral manifestations of the five Seabound Sages, e.g., "Eternity’s Sea-Serpent (coordinates)", "Infinity’s Kraken (coordinates)", "Beyond’s Merfolk (coordinates)", "Echo’s Triton (coordinates)", "Nebula’s Leviathan (coordinates)".

## Functions
### Guide to the Portal
The astrolabe could contain an encoded star map leading to the location of the ancient temple in the Material Plane where the portal to the Astral Sea is located. This could be represented by a set of unusual and cryptic constellations inscribed on the rete of the astrolabe. The players will need to decode the inscriptions to learn how to read this map. It could have the celestial coordinates of the temple, marked by a particular star alignment that occurs only once every few hundred years, for example. The players would need to figure out the time and place to align these constellations in the sky with the astrolabe, leading them to the location of the portal.

### Navigator in the Astral Sea
Once within the Astral Plane, the astrolabe could shift slightly in its form, revealing a new set of inscriptions on the rete. These inscriptions could represent the astral coordinates for the hidden pocket dimension containing the Tear of Tidalis. This part could be a multi-layered puzzle, requiring the alignment of various celestial bodies in the Astral Plane at a specific "astral time." As I mentioned earlier, the players would need to be at the exact coordinates at the exact astral time to access the pocket dimension.
