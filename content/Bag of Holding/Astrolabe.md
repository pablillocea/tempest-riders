## Description
An ancient and mysterious astrolabe stolen from the navy. A slot in the back of the object matched captain [[Gale Whiskerwind]]'s [[Ring(s)|ring]], which upon insertion released the mechanism of the object and making it operable .
## Known Information
- Magic protects it from being destroyed.
- The captain's [[Ring(s)|ring]] was passed down by her grandmother, who used to sing her a hunting [[Lullaby]]. Based on this connection, [[Gale Whiskerwind|Gale]] and the crew decided to investigate further.
- For some reason, the [[Crimson Kingdom]] wants this object at any cost. The [[Azurian Alliance]] has not yet made any overt move to retrieve it.
- More recent findings revealed that it seems to be related to an old order by the name of the [[Seabound Sages]].
## Inscriptions
The astrolabe has coded inscriptions on it. There’s text in the outer rim, in the inner disc, and on the back, around the slot where the [[Ring(s)|rings]] fit.
